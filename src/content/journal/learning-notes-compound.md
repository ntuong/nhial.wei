The goal of note-taking is not to capture everything. It’s to create *reuse*.

## The simplest system

For anything you learn, write three things:

1. **Claim:** what is true?
2. **Evidence:** why do you believe it?
3. **Use:** where does it apply?

If you can’t write “Use,” it’s probably trivia.

Over time, your notes become a personal playbook.
