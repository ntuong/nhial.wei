    This is the evergreen library—notes meant to stay useful over time.
    Each section is designed to be practical, not motivational.

  <div class="grid cols-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Career clarity in 30 minutes</h3>
      <p>
        Write: (1) what you can do, (2) what people ask you for, (3) what you want to be known for.
        The overlap is your starting point.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Credibility compounds</h3>
      <p>
        Pick one public “proof of work” habit: weekly writing, a case study per month, or a small tool.
        Do it for 90 days.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Skill building without burnout</h3>
      <p>
        Use a minimum daily commitment (15–30 minutes), and track completion only.
        Increase intensity only after consistency is stable.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Communication is leverage</h3>
      <p>
        If you can explain complex ideas clearly, you create trust. Practice turning your work into short,
        structured narratives.
      </p>

  <h2 id="decision-tools">Decision Tools</h2>
  <div class="grid cols-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>The 3-lens test</h3>
      <p>
        Evaluate decisions through: (1) learning value, (2) income value, (3) reputation value.
        If at least two are strong, proceed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Risk by reversal</h3>
      <p>
        Ask: “What would make me regret this?” Then design guardrails (time cap, budget cap, exit plan)
        before you start.
      </p>
