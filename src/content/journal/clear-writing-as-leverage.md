Clear writing is not a “nice-to-have.” It is leverage.

In most careers, decisions are made through words: messages, proposals, reports, and narratives about why something matters.

## What clarity does

- Reduces friction
- Speeds up alignment
- Builds credibility
- Makes your thinking visible

## A practical routine (20 minutes)

1. Write one paragraph: *the problem*
2. Write one paragraph: *the recommendation*
3. Write three bullets: *what changes next*
4. Cut 20% of words without losing meaning

Repeat weekly. Save your best examples. That becomes proof of work.
